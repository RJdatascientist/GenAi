## WHAT IS GENERATIVE AI?
Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of Artificial Intelligence that can create a wide variety of data, such as images, videos, audio, text, and 3D models. It does this by learning patterns from existing data, then using this knowledge to generate new and unique outputs. GenAI is capable of producing highly realistic and complex content that mimics human creativity, making it a valuable tool for many industries such as gaming, entertainment, and product design. Recent breakthroughs in the field, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) and Midjourney, have significantly advanced the capabilities of GenAI. These advancements have opened up new possibilities for using GenAI to solve complex problems, create art, and even assist in scientific research.

## TEXT GENERATION
Text Generation involves using machine learning models to generate new text based on patterns learned from existing text data. The models used for text generation can be Markov Chains, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and more recently, Transformers, which have revolutionized the field due to their extended attention span. Text generation has numerous applications in the realm of natural language processing, chatbots, and content creation.

ðŸª„ Application: ChatGPT, developed by OpenAI, is a successful platform that uses Text Generation to generate human-like responses in chat conversations. 


## IMAGE GENERATION
Image Generation is a process of using deep learning algorithms such as VAEs(variational autoencoder), GANs(Generative adversarial networks), and more recently Stable Diffusion, to create new images that are visually similar to real-world images. Image Generation can be used for data augmentation to improve the performance of machine learning models, as well as in creating art, generating product images, and more.

ðŸª„ Application: Very successful platforms such as MidJourney and DALL-E have become a popular choice for anyone seeking to generate realistic images through Image Generation techniques.

## VIDEO AND SPEECH GENERATION
Video Generation involves deep learning methods such as GANs and Video Diffusion to generate new videos by predicting frames based on previous frames. Video Generation can be used in various fields, such as entertainment, sports analysis, and autonomous driving. Video Generation can be often seen in use with Speech Generation. The models used for speech generation can be powered by Transformers. Speech Generation can be used in text-to-speech conversion, virtual assistants, and voice cloning. 

ðŸª„ Application: Platforms such as DeepBrain and Synthesia utilize Video and Speech Generation to create realistic video content, that appears as if a human was speaking on camera.
